    <p>
      The value null represents the intentional absence of any object value. It
      is one of JavaScript's primitive values and is treated as falsy for
      boolean operations.

    <h2>What is defined and undefined in JavaScript?</h2>
    <p>
      In JavaScript, they both are related to memory space and there is a very
      simple difference between them. If the variable name which is being
      accessed doesn't exist in memory space then it would be not defined, and
      if exists in memory space but hasn't been assigned any value till now,
      then it would be undefined.
