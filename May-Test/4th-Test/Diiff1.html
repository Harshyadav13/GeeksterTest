    <p>
      The differences between var, let, and const variable declaration in
      JavaScript include: Variables declared with var and const are scoped to
      the immediate function body. Variables declared with the var keyword are
      hoisted. Hoisting means that the variable can be accessed in their
      enclosing scope even before they are declared. Variables declared with the
      let keyword are block-scoped, which means the variables will have scope to
      the immediate enclosing block.
